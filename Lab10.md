# Week-10-The-Dark-Side
Challenge 1 - Steganography
The kenny.png is an encrypted file, when opened in notepad there are gibberish code but there is a pattern in the end "mpmmfffmmfmmppfpmffpmmpp" this is like kenny speaking and so using kennyspeak translator, we can get the secret message. Which is "dissolve".

Challenge 2 - A SE Anecdote
The case is about Naoki hiroshima, who had @N twitter handle. He was offered upto $50,000 for that handle. This case shows how vulnerable you are, if you do not have proper security for all the accounts. The PayPal gave away last 4 digits of his credit card and GoDaddy made him guess first two digits of his card until he got it right. His account was compromised with no verification, they just believed him. The suggestions are to not keep the credit card saved in any of those account and use gmail.com domain for most of social media accounts.

Challenge 3 - Phishing Websites
